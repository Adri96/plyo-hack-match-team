Date: July 15, 2024

Hi Michael,
Following up on our conversation last week with our Q2 metrics update:
Financial Progress:
Monthly recurring revenue grew from $180K to $245K (36% increase)
Our CAC decreased from $420 to $380 through our new referral program implementation
LTV improved to $1,680, giving us a 4.4x LTV/CAC ratio with 18-month payback
Net revenue retention hit 118% vs industry median of 102%
Customer Traction:
Signed 3 enterprise deals: Acme Corp ($50K ARR), TechGlobal ($35K ARR), and DataSys ($28K ARR)
Our cohort analysis shows Month-6 retention improved from 65% to 78% for Q1 cohorts
Customer interviews with 47 users revealed the compliance dashboard feature reduced their audit prep from 3 weeks to 4 days
Operational Execution:
Launched our enterprise SSO integration 2 weeks ahead of schedule
Reduced customer onboarding time from 14 to 6 days through our new automated workflow
Built integration with Salesforce that 73% of enterprise prospects requested during discovery calls
The regulatory changes in GDPR compliance create a 12-month window where our solution addresses the new audit requirements before competitors can rebuild their platforms.
Next 90 days: focusing on the 8 enterprise prospects in late-stage trials (total pipeline value $340K ARR) and launching our API for the developer ecosystem.

Best,
Sarah
