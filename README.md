## The Problem We Tackled

Venture capitalists face a critical inefficiency that costs them both time and opportunities: cognitive overload from scattered information across fragmented channels.
_The Core Challenge:_

-   _Scattered Information Problem:_ Critical startup data lives in silos across WhatsApp, LinkedIn Messages, Slack, Discord, emails, Crunchbase, AngelList, and Product Hunt
-   _Cognitive Flow Disruption:_ Constant context switching between 6-8 different platforms fragments mental focus and decision-making capacity
-   _Information Synthesis Overhead:_ VCs spend 60-70% of their time manually aggregating data rather than analyzing opportunities
-   _Signal-to-Noise Crisis:_ 90% of opportunities are eliminated at deal sourcing, but buried signals mean high-potential deals get missed
-   _Mental Load Accumulation:_ Managing multiple information streams simultaneously creates decision fatigue and reduces screening quality
-   _No Unified Context:_ Lack of consolidated view prevents pattern recognition and comprehensive opportunity assessment

_User Story:_ As an investor, John VC wants to simplify the management of his investment portfolio by reducing the time spent on monitoring multiple channels, minimizing cognitive load from constant context switching, and streamlining the inflow of new investment opportunitiesâ€”so he can focus on making smarter, faster investment decisions.

_Presents only high-priority opportunities to VCs_

-   Provides context-rich summaries with key decision factors
-   Enables rapid 30-second partner-level screening

## Framework

VCs' main task is to distinguish which of the startup leads they receive are good candidates for an ROI > x10. We want to model this as a funnel, where at every step, some candidates are discarded.

A possible funnel is the following one:

1. Deal Sourcing (90% of opportunities eliminated here)
   Warm introductions from portfolio companies/other VCs
   Pattern recognition from sector specialists
   Inbound from accelerators/previous investments
   Cold outreach (sub-1% conversion)
2. Initial Screen (Partner-level, 30 seconds)
   Market size and timing
   Team pedigree and founder-market fit
   Traction metrics vs. stage expectations
   Investment thesis alignment
3. Deep Dive (Junior associate research, 2-3 weeks)
   Competitive landscape analysis
   Customer reference calls
   Financial model stress-testing
   Technical/product due diligence
4. Partner Presentation (The "pitch" - only 10% of qualified deals)
   Risk mitigation story
   10x return potential demonstration
   Exit strategy clarity
5. Final Due Diligence (Legal, technical, financial)
   We also want to focus on leveraging the data thatâ€™s scattered in different channels for VCs: WhatsApp, LinkedIn Messages, emails, Slackâ€¦ Combined with more general information about business (AngelList, Crunchbase, Product Huntâ€¦)
